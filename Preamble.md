# the Game

Oath is a one-shot roleplaying game for 3-5 players, including the game master (GM), designed for the 2019 RPG Mega Jam. All you need to play is a standard set of polyhedral dice, an additional six-sided die with pips (or a d6 distinct from the other dice in some way), pens and pencils, and some paper (at least one sheet per player, plus one extra sheet for the chronicle). Optionally, for added value and enjoyment:

* Each player should have their own pen and pencil.
* Get a sheet of nice, thick, off-white drawing paper for the chronicle. If there is an artist among the group,ask them if they can provide a sheet for the table.
* Get a bunch of coins or tokens for the table—around twenty per player. I bought a set of 300 thin Chinese luck coins that I use for this purpose.
* Use that same fancy paper, or dotted paper for character sheets.
* Decorate the sheets of paper by carefully singeing the edges with fire.
* Light some candles.
* Play atmospheric music.
